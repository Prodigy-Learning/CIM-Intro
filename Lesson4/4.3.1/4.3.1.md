# Introduction to Coding - 4.3.1 - Agent Build - Repeating Actions

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use loops in MakeCode to enable our Agent to perform the same action a number of times.

We can use loops to repeat processes such as turning the agent a number of times or making the agent place a number of blocks to create a structure (e.g. building a wall)

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops**

Repeat loops are one of the type of loops available in MakeCode. 

``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` blocks in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer allows us to repeat a series of blocks a set number of times (4 times by default)

Loops will be explored in greater detail in a later unit.

## Step 3
Place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||``  block inside the default ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.

Any blocks we place inside this repeat 4 times block will run one after the other 4 times.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 4
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and an ``||AGENT:agent place back||`` block in the repeat 4 times block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Add an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` and ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block before the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block and change the number of block to move forward to 2
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.
3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.

4. Notice the Agent will place 4 blocks.
