# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 3.2.1 - Controlling your Agent

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will start to use MakeCode to code in Minecraft.

We will look at how to create blocks of code and how to make your Agent move around the world.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Making your Agent move**

With code you can make your Agent move in one of 6 directions for a specified number of blocks:
	- Forward
	- Backwards
	- Left
	- Right
	- Up
	- Down

## Step 3 
Open the ``||AGENT:AGENT||``  drawer by clicking on the Agent on the left hand side of the window.

In the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer you will find an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block. This is the block we use to move the Agent.
```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})
```

## Step 4
Drag an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer and place it under the ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.

Notice how the blocks 'click' together.

```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:
1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.
