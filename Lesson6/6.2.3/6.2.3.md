# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 6.2.3 - Errors - Errors Activity 2 - Fix your code

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Fix your code**
Hopefully you noticed that the Agent only builds one level of the wall. 

This is because wehave not instructed the Agent to move vertically.

Lets modify our code to see if we can correct this and it fixes all the errors.

## Step 2 
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 10||`` block and change its direction to up


```template
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
		agent.move(UP, 1)
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
Now lets run the code and observe what happens.
1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.
3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.
4. Did the Agent perform all the actions that you needed?
Not yet - the Agent does now build the wall up but if you count the number of blocks the wall is in length (11) and the number of blocks the wall is high (4) the code still does not do exactly what we want it to do.

## Step 5 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity to try and fix your code.
