# Introduction to Coding - Lesson 6.2.1 - Errors - Errors Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will make some mistakes in our code to demonstrate how easy it is to have errors in our code.

We will then try to find and correct the errors.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Building a wall**
You want to create some code which will build a wall 10 blocks long by 3 blocks high.

You have been given the below code by another student to perform the task.

Will it do what you expect it to?

If not what will it do?

Can you find the 3 errors in it?

How would you correct the 3 errors?

If you can answer these questions without running the code the great! If not do not worry as we will create the code to work out the errors.

## Step 3
Place an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block, an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block, an ``||AGENT:place on move true||`` block and an ``||AGENT:agent destroy obstaces true||`` from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer and place them inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "run"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent destroy obstaces true||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Place 2 ``||AGENT:agent turn left||`` blocks within the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})
```

## Step 6 @unplugged
Now lets run the code and observe what happens.
1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
2. Open the chat window by pressing the **t** key on the keyboard or if you are on a touchscreen device click the chat button at the top of the screen.
3. Enter the text **run** and press **Enter**.

4. Watch your agent appear perform some actions. **What happened? Why did the Agent only build on one level and not build a wall? Did the Agent build the length of blocks required? If not why?** (ensure your agent has blocks in their inventory and
notice they will still not place blocks!)

## Step 5 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity to try and fix your code.
